# EC2
  - Resizable compute capacity in AWS
  - Reduces time to get and boot new server instances to minutes
  - Can quickly scale up and down as computing requirements change
  - Instance types
	  - On demand - Pay fixed rate by the second, no commitment
	  - Reserved - 1 or 3 year term, considerably cheaper
	  - Spot - bid for it by the hour. Are not charged entire hour if EC2 terminates it, but will be charged if you terminate it yourself
	  - Dedicated host - you get your own host

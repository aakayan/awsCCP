# Storage Gateway
  - Service that connects on premise software appliance with cloud based storage
  - Software appliance is available to download as VM image
  - Can also get a physical device for this
  - Can use AWS management console to create gateway option you want
  - 3 different types of storage
	  - File gateway - NFS & SMP
		  - Files are stored as objects in S3 buckets
		  - Accessed through network file system
		  - Ownership, permission, timestamps durably stored in S3
		  - Once transferred to S3, they can be managed as native S3 objects, so bucket policies can apply to them
	  - Volume Gateway - iSCSI
		  - Presents your app with disk volumes using iSCSI block protocol
		  - Data written to these volumes can be backed up as point in time snapshots of your volume, and stored as EBS snapshot
		  - Snapshots are incremental backups that only capture changed blocks. Snapshot storage is compressed
		  - Stored Volumes - Volume gateway
			  - Let you store your primary data locally
			  - The entire dataset
		  - Cached Volumes
			  - Retains most frequently accessed data locally in storage gateway
			  - Caches the most actively used data
	  - Tape Gateway - VTL
		  - Durable cost effective solution to archive data into AWS
		  - Get rid of tapes
  - Summary
	  - File gateway - for flat files, stored directly on S3
	  - Volume gateway
	  - Stored volumes - entire dataset stored on site and backed up to S3
	  - Cached volumes - entire dataset stored on S3, most frequently accessed data is cached on site
	  - Gateway virtual tape library
